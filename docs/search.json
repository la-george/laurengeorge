I’m currently investigating the effects of early exposure to high temperature on Zebrafish (Danio rerio) with the intended effect of inducing phenotypic plasticity to improve factors including growth and survivability. I hope to apply the results of my preliminary study to a feed fish species in an offshore aquaculture system.\n\n  \n\n\nPhoto: Me after surviving a grueling climb up the Sleeping Bear Dunes in Michigan"
